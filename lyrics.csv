U2,One,"[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

[Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher"
U2,With or Without You,"[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you

[Verse 2]
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-ah
I can't live with or without you

[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

[Verse 3]
My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you

[Outro-Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you"
U2,I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,"[Verse 1]
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

U2,Sunday Bloody Sunday,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away

[Chorus]
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Alright, let's go!

[Verse 3]
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Chorus]
How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one

[Bridge]
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your bloodshot eyes

[Refrain]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Verse 4]
And it's true, we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today, the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On—

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday"
U2,Pride (In the Name of Love),"[Verse 1]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Verse 2]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

Nothing like love

Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

What more in the name of love?

U2,Beautiful Day,"[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stoney ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Refrain]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Bridge]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

[Refrain]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Outro]
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day"
U2,Get Out of Your Own Way,"[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Bono]
Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Verse 2: Bono]
Fight back
Don't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them
The master's lookin' for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said...

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain"
U2,Song for Someone,"[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus 1]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus 2]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone

[Outro]
And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out"
U2,Every Breaking Wave,"[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now, I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?"
U2,Where the Streets Have No Name,"[Verse 1]
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name

[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Verse 3]
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name

[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Outro]
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do"
U2,You’re the Best Thing About Me,"[Verse 1: Bono]
When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

[Verse 2: Bono]
I been crying out, ""How bad can a good time be?""
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?

[Bridge: The Edge]
I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you can't see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?"
U2,The Troubles,"[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

[Verse 1: Bono]
You think it’s easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it’s easier
To know your own tricks
Well, it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do

[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

[Verse 2: Bono]
You think it’s easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think it’s easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to

[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me then, and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control

[Bridge: Bono & Lykke Li]
God knows it’s not easy
I'm taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
God, now you can see me
I’m naked and I’m not afraid, my body’s
Sacred and I’m not ashamed

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control (someone else is in control)"
U2,Ordinary Love,"[Verse 1]
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Verse 2]
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

[Chorus]
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Bridge]
Are we tough enough
For ordinary love

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love"

Lights go down, it's dark, the jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart, a feeling so much stron-

It can't be bought, your mind can wander

Except you give me something

The night is full of holes as bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold, they twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll, they know that they can't dance
At least they know

The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few

Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

[Chorus 2]
I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again

Oh
Maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight

And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes

Damien Rice,Delicate,"[Verse 1]
We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?

[Verse 2]
We might live like never before
There's nothing to give
Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?

Damien Rice,It Takes a Lot to Know a Man,"[Verse 1]
It takes a lot to know a man
It takes a lot to understand
The warrior, the sage
The little boy enraged
It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to understand what's humming
The honey-bee, the sting
The little girl with wings

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

[Verse 2]
It takes a lot to know a man
A lot to know, to understand
The father and the son
The hunter and the gun
It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to comprehend what's coming
The mother and the child
The muse and the beguiled

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to live
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

[Bridge]
What are you so afraid to lose?
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, ""this thing is killing me"")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, ""this thing is killing me"")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, ""this thing is killing me"")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
(Crying like a baby
Saying, ""this thing is killing me"")
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you carry on your back?
(You wrote me to tell me
You're nervous and you're sorry)
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you notice when you can't laugh?
(Know you can, have to know)
(Killing me)

Damien Rice,I Don’t Want to Change You,"[Verse 1]
Wherever you are
You know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well, I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well, not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
Know that I am willing

[Chorus]
Oh, and I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

[Verse 2]
Wherever you go
Well, I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well, I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
Well, I'm more than willing

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
Oh, and I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

[Bridge]
I've never been with anyone
In the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed
'Cause water races
Water races down the waterfalls
Water races
Water races down the waterfall

[Chorus]
And I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not blind"
Damien Rice,Volcano,"[Verse 1: Damien Rice]
Don't hold yourself like that
You'll hurt your knees
Well I kissed your mouth and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down

[Chorus: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

[Verse 2: Lisa Hannigan]
Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth, your back
Is that all you need?
Don't drag my love around
Volcanoes melt me down

[Chorus: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask . . 

[Bridge: Damien Rice]
What I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new, no no
Just another phase of finding
What I really need
Is what makes me bleed
But like a new disease
Lord, she's still too young to treat

What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)

What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)

You do not need (she's still too young)
And what I am to you (oh she's still too young)

You do not need me"
Damien Rice,Cannonball,"[Verse 1]
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to say what's going on
Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I can't say what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life, it taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball

[Verse 2]
Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon...
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to cry
So come on, courage!
Teach me to be shy

[Outro]
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you just don't know"
Damien Rice,Cheers Darlin’,"Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers darlin'
I got years to wait around for you
Cheers darlin'
I've got your wedding bells in my ear
Cheers darlin'
You give me three cigarettes to smoke my tears away

And I die when you mention his name
And I lied, I should have kissed you
When we were running in the rain

What am I darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?

Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover man
Cheers darlin'
I just hang around and eat from a can
Cheers darlin'
I got a ribbon of green on my guitar
Cheers darlin'
I got a beauty queen
To sit not very far from me

I die when he comes around
To take you home
I'm too shy
I should have kissed you when we were alone

What am I darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?

Oh what am I? What am I darlin'?
I got years to wait..."
Damien Rice,Back To Her Man,"[Verse 1]
There's a look of hunger in a women with heat,
It's enough to lift an old man from his knees.
Like the piece of a puzzle he's been looking for,
He was leaning to dying, now he's coming back for more.

[Verse 2]
The look of a women when she gets you alone,
You can't see what's coming but there's blood in your bones,
There's power in your pocket and ships in your sea,
It doesn't often happen, but it happened to me.

[Chorus]
Then she goes back to her man,
Back to her man,
Back to, back to, her man.

[Verse 3]
There's a look of war in the way that you go,
But the lead in your arrow is loose, don't you know?
But whatever you got, you lost in the game,
Of picking your own pockets for someone to blame.

[Verse 4]
There may be nothing above the arc of love,
Depending on who you're dreaming of.
You can't escape when it feels like rape,
But who's raping who?

[Chorus]
Then she goes back to her man,
Back to her man,
Back to, back to, her man.

[Chorus]
She goes back to her man,
Back to her man,
Back to, back to, her man.

[Bridge]
She don't love him
(Back to her man)
She don't love him no more
(Back to her man)
She don't love him, love him
(Back to, back to, her man)
She don't love him no more

She don't love him
(She goes back to her man)
She don't love him no more
(Back to her man)
She don't love him, love him
(Back to, back to her man)"
Damien Rice,Elephant,"[Verse 1]
This has got to die
This has got to stop
This has got to lie down
Someone else on top

You can keep me pinned
It's easier to tease
But you can't paint an elephant
Quite as good as she

[Chorus 1]
And she may cry like a baby
And she may drive me crazy
Cause I am lately lonely

[Verse 2]
So why d'you have to lie?
I take it I'm your crutch
The pillow in your pillow case
Is easier to touch

And when you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
And do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?

[Chorus 2]
And she may rise, if I sing you down
And she may wisely cling to the ground
Cause I'm lately horny
So why would she take me horny?

[Bridge]
What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
You've already gone, why am I clinging?
Well I could throw it out, and I could live without
And I could do it all for you
I could be strong
Tell me if you want me to lie
Cause this has got to die

[Outro]
This has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down
With someone else on top

You can both keep me pinned
Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't make me happy
Quite as good as me

Well you know that's a lie"
Damien Rice,My Favourite Faded Fantasy,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
You could be my favourite taste to touch my tongue
I know someone who could serve me love
But it wouldn't fill me up
You could have my favourite face and favourite name
I know someone who could play the part
But it wouldn't be the same

[Chorus 1]
No, it wouldn't be the same
No, it wouldn't be the same
No, it wouldn't be the same
As with you

[Verse 2]
You could be my favourite place I've ever been
I got lost in your willingness
To dream within the dream
You could be my favourite faded fantasy
I've hung my happiness upon what it all could be

[Chorus 2]
And what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you

[Verse 3]
You could hold the secrets that save me from myself
I could love you more than love could
All the way from hell
You could be my poison, my cross, my razor blade
I could love you more than life
If I wasn't so afraid

[Chorus 3]
Of what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
Of what it all, what it all could be
With you
What it all, what it all could be
Of what it all, what it all could be
What it all, what it all could be
With you

[Bridge]
Love dissolved the bloom
Always watch it
Never let someone go or they
I ain't never loved like you

[Outro]
'Cause I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved another like you
I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved
I've never loved another like you
I've never loved
I've never loved"
Damien Rice,The Greatest Bastard,"[Verse 1]
I made you laugh, I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes
Didn't I?
I helped you open out your wings
Your legs, and many other things
Didn't I?

[Verse 2]
Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
The only one who let you go?
The one you hurt so much you cannot bear?
Well, we were good when we were good
When we were not misunderstood

[Verse 3]
You helped me love, you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive
Didn't you?
I wish that I could say the same
But when you left, you left the blame
Didn't you?

[Verse 4]
Am I the greatest bastard that you met?
The only one you can't forget?
Am I the one your truth's been waiting for?
Or am I just dreaming once again?
Some dreams are better when they end

[Chorus]
Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down

[Verse 5]
We learned to wag and tuck our tails
We learned to win and then to fail
Didn't we?
We learned that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling
Didn't we?

[Verse 6]
Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
When will we learn to let this go?
We fought so much, we've broken all the charm
But letting go is not the same
As pushing someone else away

[Bridge]
So please don't let on
You don't know me
Please don't let on
I'm not here
Please don't let on
You don't love me
'Cause I know you do
I know

[Chorus]
That some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant..."
Damien Rice,Colour Me In,"[Verse 1]
Well, I tried to repress it and I carried its crown
I reached out to undress it and love let me down
Love let me down

[Verse 2]
So I tried to erase it, but the ink bled right through
Almost drove myself crazy and these words led to you
And all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dog-less bone

[Chorus]
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then... colour me in

[Verse 3]
Well, I tried to control it and cover it up
I reached out to console it, it was never enough
Never enough

[Verse 4]
So I tried to forget it, it was all part of the show
Told myself I'd regret it, but what do I know
About all these useless dreams of living alone
Like a dog-less bone

[Chorus]
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
And then... colour me in

[Bridge]
Come let me love you
Come let me take this through the end
Of all these useless dreams of living
All these useless dreams
All these useless dreams of living
All these, oh no

[Chorus]
So come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me love you
Come let me in"
Damien Rice,The Professor & La Fille Danse,"Well I don't know if I'm wrong 'cause she's only just gone
Here's to another relationship bombed
By my excellent breed of gamete disease
I'm sure when I'm older I'll know what that means

She cried when she should and she laughed when she could
Here's to the man with his face in the mud
And an overcast play just taken away
From the lovers in love at the centre of stage

Loving is fine if you've plenty of time
For walking on stilts at the edge of your mind
Loving is good if your dick's made of wood
And the dick left inside only half understood

What makes her come and what makes her stay?
What make the animal run, run away?
What makes him stall, what makes him stand
And what shakes the elephant now, and what makes a man?

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
No I don't know you any more
No, no, no, no
Ooh yeah, hey hey hey hey

I don't know if I'm wrong; it's 'cause she's only just gone
Why the fuck is this day taking so long?
I was a lover of time, when once she was mine
I was a lover indeed, I was covered in weed

She cried when she should and she laughed when she could
Well, closer to God is the one who's in love
And I walk away cause I can
Too many options may kill a man

Loving is fine if it's not in your mind
But I've fucked it up too many times
Loving is good if it's not understood
But I'm the professor and feel that I should know

What makes her come and what makes her stay?
What make the animal run, run away and
What makes him tick, apart from his prick
And the lonelier side of the jealousy stick

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
No, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
No, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Hell I don't know you any more

Well I don't know if I'm wrong 'cause she's only just gone
Here's to another relationship bombed
By my excellent breed of gamete disease
I finished it off with some French wine and cheese

La fille danse
Quand elle joue avec moi
Et je pense que je l'aime des fois
Le silence, n'ose pas dis-donc
Quand on est ensemble
Mettre les mots
Sur le petit dodo"
Damien Rice,Accidental Babies,"Well, I held you like a lover
Happy hands and your elbow
In the appropriate place

And we ignored our others
Happy plans, for that delicate look
Upon your face

Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows
What we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well, you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands, and my foot
In the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands in the mild issue
Of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has
Accidental babies
For we are in love

Do you come
Together ever with him
Is he dark enough
Enough to see your light
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss
Do you miss my smell
And is he bold enough to take you on
Do you feel like you belong
And does he drive you wild
Or just mildly free
What about me
What about me"
Alanis Morissette,Ironic,"[Intro]
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

[Verse 1]
An old man turned 98
He won the lottery, and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought—it figures!

[Verse 2]
Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down
He thought, ""Well, isn't this nice?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought—it figures!

[Bridge]
Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

[Verse 3]
It's a traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?
A little too ironic
And yeah, I really do think

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought—it figures!

And yeah, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out"
Alanis Morissette,You Oughta Know,"[Verse 1]
I want you to know, that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died, but you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Verse 2]
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinkin' of me when you fuck her?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died, but you're still alive

And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade, as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

[Chorus]
Well, I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Why I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know"

I'm broke, but I'm happy
I'm poor, but I'm kind
I'm short, but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high, but I'm grounded
I'm sane, but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost, but I'm hopeful, baby

And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is givin' a high five

I feel drunk, but I'm sober
I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm tired, but I'm working, yeah
I care, but I'm restless
I'm here, but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby

Is that everything's gonna be quite alright
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flickin' a cigarette

[Chorus]
And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket

I'm free, but I'm focused
I'm green, but I'm wise
I'm hard, but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad, but I'm laughing
I'm brave, but I'm chicken shit
I'm sick, but I'm pretty, baby

And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well, I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playin' a piano
And what it all comes down to my friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailin' a taxi cab"
Alanis Morissette,Thank U,"[Verse 1]
How 'bout getting off of these antibiotics
How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up
How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots
How 'bout that ever elusive kudo

Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

How 'bout me not blaming you for everything
How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once
How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
How 'bout grieving it all one at a time

Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

The moment I let go of it
Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

[Verse 3]
How 'bout no longer being masochistic
How 'bout remembering your divinity
How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How 'bout not equating death with stopping

[Chorus 2]
Thank you India
Thank you providence
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you nothingness
Thank you clarity
Thank you, thank you silence

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh, oh"
Alanis Morissette,Ablaze,"[Verse 1]
First thing that you'll notice is some separation from each other
Yes, it's a lie, we've been believing since time immemorial
There was an apple, there was a snake, there was division
There was a split, there was a conflict in the fabric of life

[Verse 2]
One became two, and then everyone was out for themselves
Everyone was pitted against each other, conflict ruled the realm
All our devotions and temperaments are pulled from different wells
We seem to easily forget we are made of the same cells

[Chorus 1]
To my boy, all that energy, so vital
Love your hues and your blues in equal measure
Your comings and your goings-away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Verse 3]
Second thing you'll notice is that often we think that there's not enough
It might feel dark, it might feel lonely and you'll wonder why you're here
You'll be overcome with darkness and a sense of hopelessness
But it won't matter if you keep the core connected to the oneness

[Chorus 2]
To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Bridge]
And this cord is unbreakable
This pilot light is there in your pocket
And this bond, beyond unshakable
Even if we all forgot, all at the same time
If we forget at the same time

[Chorus 3]
To my boy, my precious, gentle warrior
To your sweetness and your strength in exploring
May this bond stay with you through all your days
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Chorus 2]
To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Outro]
To my boy
(First thing that you'll notice is that everything is temporary)
To my girl
(Next that you might know is that we will always be a family)
To my boy
(My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze)"
Alanis Morissette,​Reasons I Drink,"[Verse 1]
These are the reasons I drink
The reasons I tell everybody I'm fine even though I am not
These are the reasons I overdo it
I have been working since I can remember, since I was single digits
Now, even though I've been busted
I don't know where to draw the line 'cause that groove has gotten so deep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And nothing can give reprieve like they do
Nothing can give a break for this soldier like they do

[Chorus 1]
Here we are
I feel such rapture and my comfort is so strong, oh
One more hit
It feels so helpful in my need for respite, oh

[Verse 2]
And here are the reasons I eat
Reasons I feel everything so deeply when I'm not medicated
And so that's it, I am buying a Lamborghini
To make up for these habits, to survive this sick industry

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nothing can give reprieve like they do
Nothing can give me a break from this torture like they do

[Chorus 2]
Here we are
I feel such rapture and my comfort is so strong, oh
One more sip
It feels so helpful in my need for some long overdue respite, oh

[Bridge]
And these are the reasons I don't even think I would quit
And these are the reasons I can't even see straight
And these are the ones whom I know it so deeply affects
And I am left wondering how I would function without it

[Chorus 3]
Here we are
I feel such rapture and my comfort is so strong, oh
One more rip
I go from one lilypad to another to stay lit, oh"
Alanis Morissette,Head Over Feet,"[Verse 1]
I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case, time and again
I thought about it
You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was

[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

[Verse 2]
Your love is thick
And it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver
Than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service

[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

[Verse 3]
You are the bearer
Of unconditional things
You held your breath
And the door for me
Thanks for your patience

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
You're the best listener
That I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long
I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now, oh
I am aware now

[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

[Chorus]
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

[Outro]
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault"
Alanis Morissette,You Learn,"[Verse 1]
I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
Yeah, oh
I recommend walkin' around naked in your living room
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Swallow it down (What a jagged little pill)
It feels so good (Swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles

[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream you learn

[Verse 2]
I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone
I certainly do
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
Feel free

[Pre-Chorus]
Throw it down (The caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (To the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears

[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn

[Pre-Chorus]
Wear it out (The way a three-year-old would do)
Melt it down (You're gonna have to eventually anyway)
The fire trucks are comin' up around the bend

[Chorus]
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn

[Outro]
You grieve, you learn
You choke, you learn
You laugh, you learn
You choose, you learn
You pray, you learn
You ask, you learn
You live, you learn"
Alanis Morissette,All I Really Want,"[Verse 1]
Do I stress you out?
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, ""How appropriate!""
I don't wanna dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart, you see
But I can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with the splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

[Chorus]
And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

[Verse 2]
Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

[Pre-Chorus]
And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I'm humbled by his humble nature, yeah

[Chorus]
And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

[Bridge]
Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses falling
All around, all around

[Verse 3]
Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here, can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer

[Chorus]
And all I really want is some peace, man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

[Outro]
It's all I really want, some patience
A way to calm me down
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is some justice"
Alanis Morissette,Uninvited,"[Verse 1]
Like anyone would be
I am flattered by your fascination with me
Like any hot blooded woman
I have simply wanted an object to crave

[Chorus]
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

[Verse 2]
Must be strangely exciting
To watch the stoic squirm
Must be somewhat heartening
To watch shepherd meet shepherd

[Chorus]
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

[Verse 3]
Like any uncharted territory
I must seem greatly intriguing
You speak of my love like
You have experienced love like mine before

[Chorus]
But this is not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

[Outro]
I don't think you unworthy
But I need a moment to deliberate"
Alanis Morissette,Hands Clean,"[Verse 1]
If it weren't for your maturity, none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years, I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Verse 2]
You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me and
And I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could get messy
But, ooh, you don't seem to mind
Dude, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I've more than honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Bridge]
What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

[Verse 3]
Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could be messy, and
Ooh, I don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could get messy, and
Ooh, I don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this"
Alanis Morissette,Smiling,"[Verse 1]
This is a life of extremes
Both sides are slippery and enticing
These are my places off the rails
And this, my loose recollection of a falling
I barely remember who I failed
I was just trying to keep it together

[Chorus]
This is my first wave of my white flag
This is the sound of me hitting bottom
This, my surrender, if that's what you call it
In the anatomy of my crash

[Post-Chorus]
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still

[Verse 2]
Me, the notorious bottom dweller
Me, the ceiling-less brave explorer
Lured to the ends of overwhelm

[Chorus]
This is my first wave of the white flag
This is the sound of me hitting bottom
This, my surrender, if that's what I call it
In the anatomy of my crash

[Post-Chorus]
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still

[Verse 3]
Such pretty forks in the road
On this continuum I've been bouncing
Life flashing promise before my eyes

[Chorus]
This is my first wave of my white flag
This is the sound of me hitting bottom
This, my surrender, if I can bare it
In the anatomy of my crash

[Post-Chorus]
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still"
Alanis Morissette,Right Through You,"[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, man
You mispronounced my name
You didn't wait for all the information
Before you turned me away
Wait a minute, sir
You kind of hurt my feelings
You see me as a sweet back-loaded puppet
And you've got meal ticket taste

[Chorus]
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you

[Verse 2]
You took me for a joke
You took me for a child
You took a long hard look at my ass
And then played golf for a while
Your shake is like a fish
You pat me on the head
You took me out to wine, dine, 69 me
But didn't hear a damn word I said

[Chorus]
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you (Woo)

[Verse 3]
Oh, hello Mr. Man
You didn't think I'd come back
You didn't think I'd show up with my army
And this ammunition on my back
Now that I'm Miss Thing
Now that I'm a zillionaire
You scan the credits for your name
And wonder why it's not there

[Chorus]
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you, you"
Alanis Morissette,Forgiven,"[Verse 1]
You know how us Catholic girls can be
We make up for so much time, a little too late
I never forgot it, confusing as it was
No fun with no guilt feelings
The sinners, the saviors, the loverless priests
I'll see you next Sunday

[Chorus]
We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did

[Verse 2]
I sang Alleluia in the choir (Alleluia)
I confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man
My brothers, they never went blind for what they did
But I may as well have
In the name of the Father, the Skeptic and the Son
I had one more stupid question

[Chorus]
We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did

[Bridge]
What I learned, I rejected, but I believe again
I will suffer the consequence of this inquisition
If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven?

[Chorus]
We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did
We all had delusions in our heads
We all had our minds made up for us
We had to believe in something
So we did
We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did

[Outro]
So we did
Ooh-ooh, I, I, I
So we did"
Alanis Morissette,Perfect,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes is never quite enough
If you're flawless, then you'll win my love
Don't forget to win first place
Don't forget to keep that smile on your face

[Chorus]
Be a good boy
Try a little harder
You've got to measure up
And make me prouder

[Verse 2]
How long before you screw it up?
And how many times do I have to tell you
To hurry up?
With everything I do for you
The least you can do is keep quiet

[Chorus]
Be a good girl
You've gotta try a little harder
That simply wasn't good enough
To make us proud

[Bridge]
I'll live through you
I'll make you what I never was
If you're the best, then maybe so am I
Compared to him, compared to her
I'm doing this for your own damn good
You'll make up for what I blew
What's the problem? Why are you crying?

[Chorus]
Be a good boy
Push a little farther now
That wasn't fast enough
To make us happy
We'll love you just the way you are
If you're perfect"
