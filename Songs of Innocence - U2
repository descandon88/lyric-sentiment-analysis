[Verse 1]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus 1]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Verse 2]
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
[Pre-Chorus]
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus 1]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Bridge]
We can hear you (hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (hear you, ooh)

[Chorus 2]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Outro]
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard






[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now, I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach
[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 1]
California, then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here
Out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California, at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does

[Chorus 1]
All I know
And all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love
[Verse 2]
I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California, blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself
There's no end to grief
That's how I know

[Chorus 2]
That's how I know
And why I need to know that there is no, yeah there is no end to love
All I know and all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
All I know
And all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love
We come and go
Stolen days you don't give back
Stolen days are just enough


[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus 1]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus 2]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone

[Outro]
And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out


[Verse 1]
The star
That gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it's not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

[Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I’ve got your light inside of me
Iris, Iris

[Verse 2]
Once we are born, we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I'm sure I've met
Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again
[Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close, the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I've got your light inside of me
Iris, Iris

[Bridge]
The stars are bright but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold

You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don't fear the world it isn't there

Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me
Iris, Iris

She says
Free yourself to be yourself, if only you could see yourself
Free yourself to be yourself, if only you could see...



[Verse 1]
The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin' to hold on
To what you used to be
I’m so glad the past is all gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know

[Verse 2]
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you don’t see so well
The future’s gonna land on you
[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano

[Bridge]
You were alone
And now you’re not alone
You were alone
You are Rock N Roll
You and I are Rock N Roll
You are Rock N Roll
You and I are Rock N Roll

[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano

[Verse 1]
Face down on a broken street
There’s a man in the corner in a pool of misery
I’m in white van as a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash, I can’t tell what it is
But I take a look, and now I’m sorry I did
5:30 on a Friday night, 33 good people cut down

[Refrain]
I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore

[Verse 2]
Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls with a needle trying to spell my name
My body’s not a canvas
My body’s now a toilet wall

[Refrain]
I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore

[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
[Verse 3]
Boy sees his father crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate
Blue mink Ford, I’m gonna detonate and you're dead
Blood in the house
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world are justified by belief
Registration 1385-WZ

[Refrain]
I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore

[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
