Verse 1]
We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?

[Verse 2]
We might live like never before
There's nothing to give
Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
[Chorus]
Why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place that you've known?
Why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?

[Instrumental Outro]



[Verse 1: Damien Rice]
Don't hold yourself like that
You'll hurt your knees
Well I kissed your mouth and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down

[Chorus: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

[Verse 2: Lisa Hannigan]
Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth, your back
Is that all you need?
Don't drag my love around
Volcanoes melt me down

[Chorus: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask . .
[Bridge: Damien Rice]
What I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new, no no
Just another phase of finding
What I really need
Is what makes me bleed
But like a new disease
Lord, she's still too young to treat

What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
And what I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)

You do not need me

[Verse 1: Damien Rice]
And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time

[Verse 2: Damien Rice]
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her skies

[Chorus: Damien Rice]
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes

[Verse 3: Damien Rice]
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
[Verse 4: Damien Rice]
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial

[Chorus: Damien Rice]
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you

[Bridge: Lisa Hannigan]
Oh, did I say
That I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?

[Chorus & Outro: Damien Rice]
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
My mind
My mind...
Till I find somebody new



[Verse 1]
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to say what's going on
Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I can't say what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life, it taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball

[Verse 2]
Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon...
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to cry
So come on, courage!
Teach me to be shy
[Outro]
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you just don't know



[Verse 1]
Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small
And grow in time
And we always seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf
Too many books
Read me your favorite line
Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking
The Western Man's need to cry
He came back the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same

[Chorus]
Like time
There's always time
On my mind
So pass me by
I'll be fine
Just give me time
[Verse 2]
Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems
Louder than before
Out of doors and into stores
With bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost
At the races too many times
She broke down the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same

[Chorus]
Like time
There's always time
On my mind
So pass me by
I'll be fine
Just give me time
Like time
There's always time
On my mind
So pass me by
I'll be fine
Just give me time



Nothing unusual, nothing strange
Close to nothing at all
The same old scenario, the same old rain
And there's no explosions here

Then something unusual, something strange
Come from nothing at all
I saw a spaceship fly by your window
Did you see it disappear?

[Chorus]
Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
Tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

Nothing unusual, nothing's changed
Just a little older that's all
You know when you've found it
There's something I've learned
'Cause you feel it when they take it away
Hey hey hey

Something unusual, something strange
Come from nothing at all
But I'm not a miracle
And you're not a saint
Just another soldier
On the road to nowhere
[Chorus]
Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
Tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
Tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me

Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers darlin'
I got years to wait around for you
Cheers darlin'
I've got your wedding bells in my ear
Cheers darlin'
You give me three cigarettes to smoke my tears away

And I die when you mention his name
And I lied, I should have kissed you
When we were running in the rain

What am I darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?

Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover man
Cheers darlin'
I just hang around and eat from a can
Cheers darlin'
I got a ribbon of green on my guitar
Cheers darlin'
I got a beauty queen
To sit not very far from me
I die when he comes around
To take you home
I'm too shy
I should have kissed you when we were alone

What am I darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?

Oh what am I? What am I darlin'?
I got years to wait...


Cold, cold water
Surrounds me now
And all I've got
Is your hand

Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?

Love one's daughter
Allow me that
And I can't let go
Of your hand

Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?

Cold, cold water
Surrounds me now
And all I've got
Is your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?

[Lisa Hannigan]
I remember it well:
The first time that I saw
Your head 'round the door
'Cause mine stopped working

I remember it well:
There was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stairs
And time stopped moving

I want you here tonight, I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down

I remember it well:
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing

I remember it well:
I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth

I want you here tonight, want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
Except you my love
'Cept you my love

[Damien Rice]
Come, all ye lost
Dive into moss
And hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper maché

Come, all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
God will forgive me
But I
I whip myself with scorn, scorn

I wanna hear
What you have to say about me
Hear
If you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear
What you want
I remember December
I wanna hear
What you have to say about me
Hear
If you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear
What you want
What the hell do you want?
